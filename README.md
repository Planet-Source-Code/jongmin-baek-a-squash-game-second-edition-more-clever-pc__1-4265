## A SQUASH GAME \- Second Edition / More clever PC\!

<img src="flame.gif">
</div>

### Description

Hi, I'm back. I have updated my squash game so it's more powerful.

Anyway, I changed something so the PC player engine is more clever so nobody

can beat it. (Maybe somebody can. Though I make the program, I can't beat it.)

Now you can control your pad with your mouse. Enjoy!
 
### More Info
 
For new users! : You should check the check box on the right side to play with

the PC player engine. Try to beat it, maybe you can't.
